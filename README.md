## Purpose of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to take our previously created web application on Mars and make it even better. We scraped full-resolution images and titles of each of Mars' hemispheres, updated the web app with this information, and added a couple Bootstrap components to our code to liven things up. The result is a clean, informative app, that provides the reader with a scraping button, the most up to date Mars news article, a table of Mars facts, and four crisp images of Mars' hemispheres, along with their titles.
